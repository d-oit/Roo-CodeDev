# OCR Task Provider Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to optimize the OCR process in our VS Code extension by implementing the Task Provider API. This approach will offload OCR processing to background tasks, improve UI responsiveness, and provide better integration with VS Code's task system.

## Rationale

Currently, our OCR processing runs in the extension's main thread, which can cause UI delays and reduced responsiveness. By leveraging the Task Provider API, we can:

- Decouple OCR processing from the extension's main thread
- Provide visual progress indicators in VS Code's UI
- Allow users to configure and customize OCR tasks
- Enable task chaining and scheduling
- Improve error handling and logging

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Task Provider Infrastructure (Week 1)

1. Create `OCRTaskProvider` class implementing `vscode.TaskProvider`
2. Define OCR task definitions and task execution terminal
3. Register the task provider in extension activation
4. Implement basic task resolution and execution

### Phase 2: OCR Processing Integration (Week 2)

1. Refactor current OCR processing to work with task execution model
2. Implement progress reporting through the terminal interface
3. Add error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. Create default OCR tasks for common scenarios

### Phase 3: User Configuration (Week 3)

1. Define schema for OCR task configuration in `tasks.json`
2. Implement configuration validation
3. Add support for user-defined OCR options
4. Create documentation for user configuration

### Phase 4: Testing and Optimization (Week 4)

1. Develop unit tests for the task provider
2. Benchmark performance improvements
3. Gather feedback and refine implementation
4. Final integration and release

## Key Components

### OCRTaskDefinition

```typescript
interface OCRTaskDefinition extends vscode.TaskDefinition {
	source: string // Source of images (directory, URL, etc.)
	label: string // Display name of the task
	options: {
		// OCR processing options
		language: string // OCR language(s)
		accuracy: "high" | "normal" | "fast" // Processing quality
		outputFormat?: "text" | "json" | "markdown" // Output format
		postProcessing?: string[] // Post-processing steps
	}
}
```

### OCRTaskProvider

The main provider that creates and resolves OCR tasks:

```typescript
export class OCRTaskProvider implements vscode.TaskProvider {
	static OCR_TYPE = "ocr"

	provideTasks(): vscode.Task[] | undefined
	resolveTask(task: vscode.Task): vscode.Task | undefined

	// Helper methods for task creation and management
}
```

### OCRTaskTerminal

A pseudoterminal implementation that handles the execution of OCR tasks:

```typescript
class OCRTaskTerminal implements vscode.Pseudoterminal {
	// Events for terminal interaction
	onDidWrite: vscode.Event<string>
	onDidClose: vscode.Event<number>

	// Methods for task execution
	open(initialDimensions: vscode.TerminalDimensions | undefined): void
	close(): void
	private processOCR(): Promise<void>
}
```

## Technical Challenges

1. **Concurrency Management**: Ensuring multiple OCR tasks don't overload system resources
2. **Progress Reporting**: Implementing accurate progress reporting for long-running OCR tasks
3. **Error Recovery**: Handling failures gracefully and providing meaningful error information
4. **State Management**: Preserving task state between VS Code sessions

## Expected Benefits

1. **Performance Improvements**:

    - 40-60% reduction in UI blocking during OCR operations
    - Support for concurrent OCR processing

2. **User Experience**:

    - Visual progress indicators for long-running OCR tasks
    - Integration with VS Code's built-in task system
    - Custom task configuration through familiar `tasks.json`

3. **Developer Experience**:
    - Cleaner separation of concerns in the codebase
    - Better testability of OCR functionality
    - Simplified management of long-running operations

## Success Metrics

1. Reduced main thread blocking time during OCR operations (measured with VS Code's Performance tools)
2. Increased responsiveness during OCR processing (subjective user feedback)
3. Successful execution of OCR tasks in various configurations and environments

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Task Provider infrastructure
- **Week 2**: OCR processing integration
- **Week 3**: User configuration support
- **Week 4**: Testing, optimization, and documentation
- **Week 5**: Release and user feedback collection

## Conclusion

Implementing a Task Provider for OCR operations represents a significant architectural improvement that will enhance both performance and user experience. By leveraging VS Code's task system, we can provide a more integrated, configurable, and responsive OCR processing capability.
